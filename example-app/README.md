# FB3Reader Example App


This is an example app that uses FB3Reader to display FB3 books. It shows most of the FB3Reader library features such as:

- styling
- bookmark management
- text and media caching

## Installation

First of all, be sure to have `FB3Reader` library built itself.
Then, go to `example-app` directory (`cd example-app`) and install all required dependencies via `npm install`.

## Building and running

You can now build an app via `npm run build` command. If you need a quick review, you can use command `npm run start` to launch lite-server which will serve `dist/index.html` and a sample FB3 book. After this, **Example FB3Reader app** will be available from `locahost:8000`.
